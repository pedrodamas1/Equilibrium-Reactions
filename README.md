# Simultaneous Equilibrium Chemical Reactions Solver

## Overview

Welcome to the Simultaneous Equilibrium Chemical Reactions Solver! This Python project offers a robust and intuitive framework for solving complex equilibrium problems involving multiple chemical reactions. Leveraging object-oriented programming principles and linear algebra techniques, it provides a systematic approach to tackle diverse scenarios in computational chemistry.

## Features

- **Object-Oriented Design:** Each chemical species and reaction is encapsulated as distinct objects, enhancing modularity and extensibility.
- **Linear Algebra Framework:** Equilibrium equations are treated as a system of linear equations, enabling efficient numerical computation of equilibrium concentrations.
- **Intuitive Interface:** User-friendly interface for inputting reaction equations, initial conditions, and exploring equilibrium solutions.
- **Versatility:** Capable of handling a wide range of simultaneous equilibrium reactions, from simple acid-base equilibria to more complex titration processes.
- **Educational Value:** Provides a valuable learning tool for students and researchers to deepen their understanding of chemical equilibrium concepts.

## Examples

The project includes several examples to demonstrate its capabilities:

1. **Calculation of the pH of Acetic Acid:** Illustrates the determination of pH in a solution containing acetic acid, showcasing the project's object-oriented approach and linear algebra solver.
